\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{here} are a more and more photovoltaic systems deployed world wide every day.
This is all done with the mindset to harvest as much solar energy as possible in order to provide a sustainable electricity source for our increasing needs.
Experts in this area see it as a real posibility that in the future our energy grid will be based on a lot of smaller electricity sources like these home PV systems, the so called micro-grid.
One of the main drawbacks of these micro-grid is controllability, because of the sheer number of contributers.
Currently there is a lot of rotating mass connected to the energy grid (because of all the heavy metal turbines), tinny fluctuations in the power flow of the grid are smoothened by this energy buffer.
Bigger fluctations are controlled by the network operator by increasing or decreasing the power generator at the different sites.
Keeping this in mind, a big disadvantage can be seen when looking back at the home PV systems.
To start with, there will be almost no intertia in a micro-grid system and on top of that the power generation is heavily depedent on the current irradiance by the sun and cloud movement.
So this method of generating energy is way less controllable and also really unpredictable.
This proposes some challenges in the future development of the power grid.

Anonther major drawback of current photovoltaic systems is the great impact of partial shading of a panel on the whole system.
Because all the cells are connected in series, a smaller generated current in one cell decreases the current through all cells.
A lot of research is done in this area to solve this not so well known problem, all possibilties are discussed in \cite{SoCeBa}.
The authors of this thesis also propose and design an implementation to solve this problem.
In general, most implementations use a microcontroller which optimizes the power output in someway.
With current trends of all devices being more and more connected to the internet (the Internet of Things era), this might also provide the posibilities to provide a solution for the problem of the predictability of micro-grid PV systems.

In the future, all the PV modules will be 'smart' (i.e. have a microcontroller in them), this can be used to collect huge ammounts of data of the current irradiance.
Using all this data and the geographical locations, the resolution of cloud movement predictions can be enhanced greatly.
These more accurate cloud predictions or models can be fed back into the system in order to make a short term prediction of the power generation of these small PV systems.

In this report the future problems mentioned above will be further explained in \bigref{sec:problem_definition}.
The algorithm designed to the prediction and the simulation to verify it are explained in the \nameref{sec:implementation} part.
The different subparts of the test setup are explained in \nameref{sec:experiment} after which some conclusions are drawn.

\section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:problem_definition}
\IEEEPARstart{O}{f} course it is 
TODO: move part of introduction to here?
Some parts of the intro are too detailed for the introduction (because they are not directly related to the prototype, however they are needed to show the importance of the system we made).

\clearpage

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
\IEEEPARstart{A}{s} the main purpose of this research is to show the viability of the proposed prediction method, the designed algorithm is explained in the next section.
This algorithm is tested using simulation data generated by the simulator explained afterwards.

\subsection{Algorithm}\label{sec:implementation-algorithm}
Cloud predictions currently uses complex weather models because of their many variables and big simulation area these simulations are really computationally intensive.
Meteorology instutes often have supercomputers with 10s or 100s thousand of cores.
When this application would be used in a full scale or real world setting, algorithms can of course use differential equations or machine learning.
However because we are keeping the number of nodes relatively low, equally spaced and are using a controlled test setup, many simplifications can be done to the algorithm to the point where just a simple loop can be used.
Inside this loop, the correlation between the different time domain signals measured at the different houses can be found.
When there is a correlation between these signals, it can be stated that the same cloud was above both clouds.
This correlation can be implemented using a convolution, the location of the highest peak gives the time difference between the signals.
This time difference is the key towards prediction of course.
All the different arrival times can be fitted, using this fit a prediction can be made.

In \autoref{fig:flowchart} this algorithm is shown using a flowchart, a small remark is made for each step.

\paragraphC{get samples} First the Raspberry Pi is given the command to ask all the I2C slaves (i.e. the houses) for their ADC samples.
Using a threshold value, this is converted to a binary value indicated shaded or not.

\paragraphC{cloud detection} The data is checked to see if a cloud has appeared.

\paragraphC{Get Cloud Shape} When a cloud is found, the time domain signal of this cloud at the house where it is first detected will be selected as the reference shape.

\paragraphC{Find Correlation} Using this cloudShape, a loop finds all the correlations between this shape and the data of the other houses.

\paragraphC{Find Peaks} The location of the peaks in the correlations tells the delay between the 2 signals.
Because the start time of the first cloud is known, the arrival times can be calculated.

\paragraphC{Fit Arrival Times} All these arrival times can be fitted.

\paragraphC{Extrapolate Fit} Extrapolating this fit, gives a prediction for the arrival time of the cloud at another house (i.e. ETA).

\paragraphC{Send ETAs} These ETAs are send back to the RPi, so it can warn the nodes about upcomming clouds (the nodes will then change their LED Status).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation}\label{sec:implementation-simulation}
To test the prediction algorithm, some validation data was needed.
To easy the process of troubleshooting this is done best by using a simulation which can be wrapped around the prediction algorithm.
The basic function of this simulation is to generate clouds and store the data.
To accomodate multiple different scenarios everything is parametrized.
Which means that it is easy to change the grid size, the number of houses in each direction of the grid, both cloud dimensions, cloud origin, cloud speed and of course the number of Simulation Steps.
The data is saved to a \texttt{.mat} file and also visuallized in plots, these frames are also combined to into a \texttt{.gif}.
Below some different simulation frames are shown.

\end{figure}

\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experiment}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} goal of this experiment is to provide a prototype showing that this method could work in the future.
The main goal of this Experimental Setup thus is to just show the working version of the algorithm.

\subsection{Hardware}\label{sec:implementation-hardware}
Because the main goal of this prototype is to show that the algorithm works, a lot of simplifications can be made on the hardware level.
The next sections discuss different subparts of the hardware implementation.

\subsection{Nodes}
In real-life this future system would consist of many nodes connected to a network.
These can be either single smart modules, or the data of the panels can already be merged by the MPPT and inverter of the system, which can act as a gateway to the network.
For this prototype, there barely any requirements regarding the microcontroller.
It should just have at least 1 ADC channel for the sensor and a method for communication.
To save on costs, a bunch of cheap Arduino Nano's from ebay are used.
To demonstrate the prototype, we will just use 9 nodes, in case this all works fine and there is more time, we already have the hardware for 25 nodes.

\subsection{Sensor}
The main feature of the node will be to measure the irradiance seen at that node.
In the real-life system, this will be done by simply measuring the voltage and current and multiplying the to get the output power.
Using the specifications of the panel, this directly results in the irradiance level.
However, because solar panels would be the biggest part of the BOM, some simplifications would be nice.
There are multiple sensor to measure irradiance, for example photodiodes and Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs).

Photodiodes are really fast and accurate, however reading their output value can be quite tricky.
LDRs on the other hand can just be used in a simple voltage divider, and since we just need to make a distinction between shaded or clear view, consistency and calibration does not really matter.

In order to check the difference, we did a comparision test with 3 PV modules and 3 LDRs by measuring their output over the period of a few days next to an attic window.
See \autoref{fig:sensors} and \autoref{fig:sensors-zoom}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./resources/sensors.eps}
    \caption{A three day comparison of 5 LDRs and 3 PV modules}\label{fig:sensors}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./resources/sensors-zoom.eps}
    \caption{One day selection of \autoref{fig:sensors}}\label{fig:sensors-zoom}
\end{figure}

Of course the output of the PV modules decreases when shaded and because the LDR was put in the bottom part of the voltage divider, and its resistance decreases with more irradiance, the output is high when shaded.
So when looking at the two different groups, the parabolic shape of the sun intensity throught the day can be clearly seen.
Also the correlation is quite obvious, when the PV outputs drop because of a cloud, the LDR output values increase (see \autoref{fig:sensors-zoom} annotation \emph{B} for a cloud and \emph{C} for a high irradiance peak).
The spikes during the night, e.g. \emph{A} in \autoref{fig:sensors}, are caused by the attic light being turned on.
As a last remark it can be clearly seen that two of the LDRs have a different offset compared to the other 3.
This is due to two different resistors being used in the voltage divider.
The tree LDRs using the \SI{2.2}{\kilo\ohm} resistors (as opposed to the other 2 \SI{4.7}{\kilo\ohm}) gives a bigger fluctation difference, making it easier to detect clouds, so this value will be used in the final setup

\subsection{Network}
In the real-life system, connection all the PV systems of a country would be a challenge.
However with the current trends in IoT and Big Data, this would be no problem in the future.
Different network architectures all have their own benifits of course.
To just name a few, one can simply connect it to the wired internet that is usually already present in the house.
This would be quite cheap, however connecting all IoT devices this way would fill this quite fast.
Current wireless developments such as LoRa prove a nice alternative, as it is specifically designed for IoT applications.
In this prototype setup, something more simple can be used such as I2C.

\subsection{System Integration}
As the main server in this system, a Raspberry Pi is used because of its perfect of this application since it has a full Linux OS and multiple connectivity interfaces.
To first test the basic setup functionality, a Python script was created that runs on the Pi and sends and receives data over the I2C bus.
The algorithm however runs in \matlab, this gab can be bridged by something like a log file or something.
However, \matlab offers a really good solution for this with their `Hardware Support Packages'.
After installing the package for your specific hardware platform as an Add-On to your \matlab, you get almost full control over the hardware platform directly from within \matlab running on your computer.
(\matlab supports many different hardware platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduinos, Lego but also many instrumentation devices.)
Using this package, communicating with the different nodes was as easy as just using \texttt{read} and \texttt{write} to the node address from within \matlab.

\end{figure}

For the Arduino Nano, a header is designed that has the LDR, but also 3 LEDs (Green, Orange, Red) which can be used as status indicators, also the I2C connections are on this header.
The schematic of the header can be seen in \autoref{fig:schematic}, the soldered hardware looks like \autoref{fig:nano}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\IEEEPARstart{I}{t} can indeed be concluded that the proposed solution can indeed help solving future problems in the power grid.
As can be seen in the video \footnote{\url{https://goo.gl/uQje52}}, the idea of the solution is well demonstrated with this prototype.
Most of the houses are needed to make a proper fit to base the prediction on, but it can be seen that at the last two houses, the LED warning are spot on.
So in order to succesfully use this solution, more work needs to be done to efficiently scale up the algorithm starting of by making proper models and using excisting cloud simulation software.
